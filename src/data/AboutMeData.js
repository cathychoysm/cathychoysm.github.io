`I love solving problems and finding creative solutions.

I thrive in the dynamic world of programming. My journey began with a revelatory experience at foodpanda, where I discovered the transformative power of coding in streamlining everyday tasks. Since then, I've been hooked on the art and science of software engineering, particularly in front-end development.

Embarking on a new chapter, I bring a robust skill set encompassing Javascript, HTML, CSS, and React. I don't just see code as lines on a screen; I see it as a gateway to innovative solutions. My commitment is to continuously expand my technical repertoire, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in problem-solving through programming.`
